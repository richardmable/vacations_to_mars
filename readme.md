#Sinatra Business Website
> This website will have 4 pages: a landing page, description page, past trips page, and a booking confirmation page
> The idea is to similiar style it like AirBnB.

###The wireframe sketch of the site can be found [here](https://precursorapp.com/document/Sinatra-Business-Website-17592202522268)

##Landing Page

* Will have links to all the other pages.
* Contains a navbar that is fixed and will appear on all pages (place in layout.erb)
* Ideally the navbar is a slideout style menu
* Will have a moving background banner
* Will have a footer and a "book here" at the bottom

##Booking Page

* The booking page will have a form to book where user input is taken and displayed onto the booking confirmation page

##Decsciption Page

* Describes the idea behind Vacations to Mars

##Booking Confirmation Page

* Displays the users input for booking and "confirms" it

###Ruby Application

>Create a small Ruby application that geolocate's the user's location, and automatically creates
>a Google map route to the "launchpad". 

###Lightbox application
>There will be a "reminder" that pops up asking to book that will appear on the pages.
