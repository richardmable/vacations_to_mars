#Sinatra Business Website: Mars Quest
> This website will have 4 pages: a landing page, description page, past trips page, and a booking confirmation page.
 The idea is to similiarly style it like AirBnB.

###The wireframe sketch of the site can be found [here](https://precursorapp.com/document/Sinatra-Business-Website-17592202522268)

##Landing Page

* Will have links to all the other pages.
* Contains a navbar that is fixed and will appear on all pages (place in layout.erb)
* The navbar will be a slideout style menu
* Will have a moving background banner _will be in version 2.0_
* Will have a footer and a "book here" at the bottom

##Booking Page

* The booking page will have a form to book where user input is taken and displayed onto the booking confirmation page

##Reviews Page

* Written reviews from the most promient guests of Mars Quest.

##Booking Confirmation Page

* Displays the users input for booking and "confirms" it

###Ruby Application

>Create a small Ruby application that geolocate's the user's location, and automatically creates
>a Google map route to the "launchpad". 
_This has been moved to a later version of this website, however and IP check function was put into the Ruby script and prints to terminal._

###Lightbox application
>There will be a "reminder" that pops up asking to book that will appear on the pages.
